# Introduction

This vignette demonstrates how to use `myPackage` to explore the **Fire Weather Index (FWI)** dataset interactively.

# Installing the package

```r
install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("ETC5523-2025/assignment-4-packages-and-shiny-apps-svis0010-beep")
library(myPackage)

```
#Launch the Interactive Shiny app

The package includes a Shiny app to interactively explore FWI values across years:

```r
launch_app()

```
#App Features

Select Years: Use the slider to choose how many years to display.

Interactive Plot: The plot updates automatically to reflect the selected years.

Insight: Observe trends in the Fire Weather Index over time.

This allows users to explore meteorological fire danger trends in SE Australia.

# Dataset Included

The package includes the cleaned `fwi` dataset with the following variables:

Variable           Description

`year`            Year of observation 
`fwi_index`       Fire Weather Index Value 

The data was sourced from KNMI Climate Explorer
. It was originally monthly, but we aggregated it to yearly averages for easier exploration.

# EXAMPLE of FUNCTIONS YOU CAN USE
Explore the dataset directly in R:
```r
# View first few rows
head(fwi)

# Summary statistics
summary(fwi)
```
#Interpreting the outputs

Year (x-axis): The time period of observation.

FWI Index (y-axis): Represents fire danger based on weather variables like temperature, rainfall, humidity, and wind speed.

Trend: Higher FWI values indicate more extreme fire weather conditions. Use the slider to see changes over time interactively.

#Conclusion
`myPackage` provides an interactive way to explore the Fire Weather Index dataset in SE Australia, both through the Shiny app and directly in R. This vignette demonstrates installation, launching the app, exploring the dataset, and interpreting the outputs.
