# Introduction

This vignette demonstrates how to use `myPackage` to explore the MTCARS dataset interactively.

# Installing the package

```r
install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("ETC5523-2025/assignment-4-packages-and-shiny-apps-svis0010-beep")
library(myPackage)

```
#Launch the Interactive Shiny app

The package includes a Shiny app to interactively explore the dataset:

```r
launch_app()

```
#App Features

Select Variables: Choose X and Y axes from car attributes.

Filter Data: Use the slider to display a subset of cars.

Interactive Plot: The plot updates automatically as selections change.

Users can compare relative metrics and view differences through an interactive map.

# Dataset Included

The package includes the cleaned mtcars_clean dataset with the following variables:
mpg = Miles per gallon
disp = Engine displacement
hp = Gross horsepower
wt = Weight (1000lbs)

# EXAMPLE of FUNCTIONS YOU CAN USE
```r
head(mtcars_clean)
summary(mtcars_clean)

```
#Interpreting the outputs

X-axis and Y-axis: Select car attributes to visualize their relationship.

Number of points: Limit how many cars are displayed for faster interaction.

Trend: For example, selecting displacement (x-axis) and mpg (y-axis) typically shows a negative trend, meaning as displacement increases, mpg tends to decrease.

Interactive plots: Use the app to explore different variable combinations to gain insights on how car attributes are related.

#Conclusion
myPackage provides an interactive way to explore the MTCARS dataset, both through the Shiny app and directly in R. This vignette demonstrates installation, launching the app, and using core functions.
